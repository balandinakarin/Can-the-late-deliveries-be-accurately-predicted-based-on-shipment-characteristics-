This project focuses on **predicting whether a delivery arrives on time or late based on shipment characteristics**.

The main research question of the project is: “Can late deliveries be accurately predicted using information about shipments?”

To answer this question, a dataset containing delivery and shipment information was analyzed and used to train a machine learning model.

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prachi13/customer-analytics) used in this project consists of shipment records, where each row represents a single delivery. The data includes information such as shipment weight, shipment cost, mode of shipment, warehouse location, product importance, and customer-related variables like gender, number of prior purchases, and customer care calls. The target variable in the dataset is Reached.on.Time_Y.N, where the value 1 means the delivery arrived on time and the value 0 means the delivery was late. This target variable was kept in its original form throughout the project.

Before building a prediction model, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) was performed with the help of the **Seaborn** library to better understand the dataset. This step helped identify basic patterns and relationships in the data. First, the distribution of on-time and late deliveries was examined. On-time deliveries were more common than late deliveries, but a significant number of late deliveries was still present, making the dataset suitable for prediction. Next, the relationship between delivery status and mode of shipment was explored. Differences between shipment modes were observed, suggesting that the type of transport may influence whether a delivery arrives on time. Finally, shipment weight was analyzed using a box plot. The visualization showed that late deliveries generally have higher shipment weights, indicating that heavier shipments are more likely to experience delays.

After exploring the data, a Logistic Regression model was used to predict delivery status using the **Scikit-learn** library. Logistic Regression was chosen because it is a simple and interpretable classification model, making it suitable for a beginner-level project. The dataset was split into training and test sets, with 80 percent of the data used for training the model and 20 percent used for testing its performance. Categorical variables were converted into numerical form using OneHot Encoding, while numeric variables were kept as they were.

The trained model achieved an accuracy of around 66 percent, meaning that about two thirds of the deliveries were classified correctly. The evaluation results showed that the model performs better at predicting on-time deliveries than late deliveries. This outcome is expected, as delivery delays are influenced by many real-world factors that are not fully captured in the dataset. Despite this limitation, the model provides a reasonable baseline for understanding delivery performance.

An important part of the project was interpreting the model results. Logistic Regression allows for examining coefficients that show how each feature influences the prediction. Positive coefficient values indicate features that increase the likelihood of on-time delivery, while negative values indicate features associated with late delivery. The analysis showed that product importance, mode of shipment, and warehouse location have a strong influence on delivery outcomes. In contrast, a higher number of customer care calls and prior purchases are more associated with late deliveries. Shipment weight and cost had smaller effects compared to other variables.

Overall, this project shows that shipment characteristics can be used to predict delivery status to a moderate extent. While the model is not perfect, it provides useful insights into which factors are most relevant for delivery delays. The project also demonstrates the full data analysis process, from understanding the data and creating visualizations to building a model and interpreting its results.
